# Big-Mart-Store-Sales-Prediction

## Problem Statement
Nowadays, shopping malls and Big Marts keep track of individual item sales data in order to forecast future client demand and adjust inventory management. In a data warehouse, these data stores hold a significant amount of consumer information and particular item details. By mining the data store from the data warehouse, more anomalies and common patterns can be discovered.

## Approach
The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine learning algorithms thatâ€™s best fit for the above case.

## Result
Build a solution that should able to predict the sales of the different stores of Big Mart according to the provided dataset.
